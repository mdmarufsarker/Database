# SQL Subsets

In SQL, subsets refer to smaller sets of data that are derived from a larger set of data based on certain criteria or conditions. Subsets are typically generated using the SELECT statement along with various clauses like WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, etc. These clauses help filter, group, and sort the data to produce subsets that meet specific requirements.

Here's a brief overview of some common SQL clauses used to create subsets:

1. WHERE clause: Used to filter rows based on specified conditions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

2. GROUP BY clause: Used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.

```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;
```

3. HAVING clause: Used to filter grouped rows based on specified conditions.

```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING condition;
```

4. ORDER BY clause: Used to sort the result set by one or more columns.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2;
```

By combining these clauses, you can generate various subsets of data from your database tables based on your requirements. These subsets are useful for performing analysis, generating reports, and extracting relevant information from large datasets.
