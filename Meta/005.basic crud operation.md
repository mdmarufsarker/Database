# Basic CRUD Operation

In MySQL, CRUD refers to the basic operations that can be performed on database records. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Below are examples of how each operation is typically executed in MySQL:

1. Create (INSERT):

To add new records to a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');
```

2. Read (SELECT):

To retrieve records from a table:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

3. Update (UPDATE):

To modify existing records in a table:

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```

Example:

```sql
UPDATE users SET email = 'new_email@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
```

4. Delete (DELETE):

To remove records from a table:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

Example:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

These are the fundamental CRUD operations in MySQL, allowing you to manage data within your database tables effectively.
